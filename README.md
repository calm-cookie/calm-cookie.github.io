## Hi, I'm Uday.

I am a researcher working in an experimental AMO physics laboratory, on building a quantum computer out of trapped atomic ions. I have a bachelor's in computer science and a master's in physics. In the pursuit of building a quantum computer and relishing the rich physics underneath, I intent to commence my doctoral studies in applied physics in 2024.
